|------------------------|-------------|----------|
| componentSupport       | Indicates if components (aka modules) support should be enabled in the CLI. Defaults to `false` | Yes |
| minVersion             | Minimum version of Azure CLI to install. Defaults to `2.0`.   | Yes |
| pythonTools            | Indicates if Python tools should be installed for Azure ML. Defaults to `false` | Yes |
| pythonVersion          | Python version to use. Defaults to 3.8. | Yes |


**Sample usage**

> Configure Azure ML CLI in preview (2.0) and initializes conda.

```yml
- template: templates/aml-cli-install/step.yaml
  parameters:
    componentSupport: false
    minVersion: 2.0
```

## aml-env-build

Builds an Azure ML Environment in the local instance using `conda` and checks that the builds are completed without errors. If a library can't be installed, this action will fail. Note that this build action only can build environments inside the agent running the action. Building the environment in a `container` is not supported by the moment but in roadmap.

**Inputs**

| Parameter     | Description | Required |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| envFile       | Path to the environment file to build. Note that this is not the `conda_dependencies.yml` file. Wildcards paths are supported. | Yes | 


**Sample usage**

> Builds the environment definition at `environments/myenv/environment.yml`.

```yml
- template: templates/aml-env-build/step.yaml
  parameters:
    envFile: environments/myenv/environment.yml
```

## aml-env-ensure

Ensures or checks that a given Azure ML Environment exists on Azure. Checks if it can be correctly deployed on the target Azure ML Workspace and checks if there were alterations in the conda dependencies file that requires a new version of the environment to be deployed. That means that any change in the environment definition will be captured and failed if they don't match with the registered version.

**Inputs**

## aml-endpoint-deploy

Deploys a model endpoint in Azure Machine Learning Services all along with all the deployments it contains. Logs are collected and uploaded.

| location                   | Location where resources will be placed. See Azure supported regions for a list of possibe values | Yes |
| deploymentName             | Display name for the deployment. | Yes |
| template                   | `JSON` ARM template. This template will be created as a Template resource in the resource group mentioned. | Yes |
| Version                    | Version of the template your are creating. Defaults to `1.0`. | No |
| parameters                 | `JSON` ARM template parameters file. If parameters of type `secureString` are specified, pass them here. Use the format `parameter1=value1 parameter2=value2`. | No |

**Sample usage**

> Deploy resources with `secureString` paramters.

```yml
- template: templates/azure-arm-template-deployment/action.yaml
  parameters:
    azureServiceConnectionName: $(SERVICECONNECTION)
    resourceGroup: my-resourcegroup-dev
    location: eastus2
    deploymentName: mydeployment
    template: workspaces/templates/deploy.json
    version: 1.0
    parameters: workspaces/dev/deploy.parameters.json computeAdminUserName=$(computeAdminUserName) computeAdminUserPassword=$(computeAdminUserPassword)
```

## pylint-run

Run lintering over the source code. 

**Inputs**

| Parameter                  | Description | Required |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------|
| source                     | Directory where the source code is located. Defaults to current directory `.` | Yes |
| moduleOrPackage            | Module or package over which to run lintering. Defaults to `*`, meaning all the modules will be evaluated.  | Yes | 
| useConda                   | Indicates if the tests will run using an specific conda environment. Defaults to `false`. | No |
| condaEnvName               | Name of the conda environment to use. Required if `useConda` is `true`. | No |
| disable                    | Indicates which rules should not be checked. Coma separeted values are possible. Defaults to empty. | No |
| pkgWhitelist               | Indicates which packages should not be checked for lintering. | No |

**Sample usage**

> Runs `PyLint` for code in folder `src`. All the code is evaluated. Rules `W1023` and `C0103` are not validated. Uses a conda environment named `cicd`. This environment should be created beforehand.

```yml
- template: templates/pylint-run/step.yaml
  parameters:
    source: src
    useConda: true
    condaEnvName: cicd
    disable: W1203,C0103
```

# conda-setup

Installs and setup conda to work in the agent.

| Parameter                  | Description | Required |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------|
| condaFile                  | Conda file for the environment to create, if any. | No |
| activate                   | Inidicates if the environment has to be activated. If no environment is provided, this affects the `base` environment. Defaults to `false` | No | 
| envName                    | Name of the environemnt to create, if any. This name is used if a name is also indicated in `condaFile`. | No |
| python                     | Version of `Python` to use. If a `conda file` is provided, then the one indicated there is used. Defaults to `3.8` | No |

**Remarks**

On Github Actions, agents execute bash without a profile and hence, if you try to run `conda activate` you will recieve the error `conda is not initialized`. To workaround this problem, if you want to use later `conda activate` run `source $CONDA/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` before to ensure proper initialization of `conda` in your shell.

**Sample usage**

**#1**
> Initialize conda but no environment is created.

```yml
- template: templates/conda-setup/step.yaml
```

**#2**
> Initialize conda and create an environment from a file.

```yml
- template: templates/conda-setup/step.yaml
  parameters:
    condaFile: conda_dependencies.yml
    activate: true
```

**#3**
> Initialize conda and create an environment from scratch with `Python` version `3.8`.

```yml
- template: templates/conda-setup/step.yaml
  parameters:
    envName: myproject
    activate: true
    python: 3.9
```
